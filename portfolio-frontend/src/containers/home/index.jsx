            <p>I'm Peiyi, a front-end developer. I generally use VS Code and Chrome to work on my web dev projects. My experience in web development started with me joining a Bootcamp to introduce myself to front-end development (HTML and CSS). I found myself enjoying the achievement of building a website. So I decided to pursue further into this field by earning a certificate from a community college.</p>
